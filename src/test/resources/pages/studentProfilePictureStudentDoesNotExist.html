                    TEAMMATES could not locate what you were trying to access. <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    Possible reasons include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You clicked on a link received in email, but the link was mangled by the email software. Try copy-pasting the entire link into the Browser address bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The entity (e.g. course, session) you were trying to access was deleted by an instructor after the link was sent to you by TEAMMATES.
                        <br><br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                If the problem persists, contact TEAMMATES support at <a>teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
                <br><br>
                <b>Note: </b>If the problematic link was received via email, remember to copy-paste that email content when contacting TEAMMATES support.
